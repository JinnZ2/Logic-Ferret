Philosophy of the Score
	•	Not all distortion is equal.
	•	Some tactics (like false urgency) are annoying.
	•	Others (like agency removal or propaganda bias) are existential threats to autonomy.

So we assign weights based on how much the distortion disrupts clarity and choice.

⸻

 Default Weights (tweakable later):

Sensor	Weight	Why
Propaganda Tone	1.2	Influences emotional tone and worldview
Reward Manipulation	1.0	Hooks attention, but often superficial
False Urgency	1.1	Triggers panic, blocks rational response
Gatekeeping	1.3	Denies access to knowledge, preserves power
Narrative Fragility	1.4	Collapses coherence, hides truth behind fog
Propaganda Bias Index	1.5	Persuades through distortion of reality
Agency Restriction	1.6	Removes consent, simulates choice
